# Guessing Game Project
 
This is for the Guessing Game Project. It makes use of the readline module, and has the user initially enter a number of attempts for the game to run.
Then it asks the user for a minimum and maximum number, and generates a number in that range, inclusive, for the user to guess.

Until the user guesses the right number or the number of attempts runs out, the user is repeatedly asked for their guess.

If the guess is too low or too high, the user is notified so. If the number of guesses have run out and the user hasn't been successful, the lose message and 
correct answer is printed. If the user makes a correct guess, then the win message is printed.
